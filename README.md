# Ludus, in Clojure
## Or, CLudus

A reference implementation of an interpreter for the Ludus programming language. It's written in Clojure. It's a tree-walk interpreter, very slow. (We are following the Nystrom path from _Crafting Interpreters_.)

### Use
* Clone this repo.
* Have Clojure and Leiningen installed.
* `lein run {script}`, it runs your script in Ludus!
* Ludus is very much a work in progress; see [the ludus-spec repo for progress notes](https://github.com/thinking-with-computers/ludus-spec).
