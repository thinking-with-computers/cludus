    "# Ludus prelude documentation
These functions are available in every Ludus script.
The documentation for any function can be found within Ludus by passing the function to `doc!`, 
e.g., running `doc! (add)` will send the documentation for `add` to the console.

## A few notes
**Naming conventions.** Functions whose name ends with a question mark, e.g., `eq?`, return booleans.
Functions whose name ends with an exclamation point, e.g., `make!`, change state in some way.
In other words, they _do things_ rather than _calculating values_. 
Functions whose name includes a slash either convert from one value to another, e.g. `deg/rad`,
or they are variations on a function, e.g. `div/0` as a variation on `div`.

**How entries are formatted.** Each entry has a brief (sometimes too brief!) description of what it does.
It is followed by the patterns for each of its function clauses.
